# Lost Levels

Lost Levels is a 2D platformer that I am currently creating for my A-Level CS coursework.

Admittedly, game development is not a major interest of mine. My original idea was to write up a VDM, possibly emulating an 80386 (or compatible) microprocessor, but this seemed overkill. However, the concept of working on a 2D physics simulation engine has seemed interesting to me and I may experiment with such in the future.

This game was originally developed locally until I decided to instantiate a Git repository for it, albeit after the core of the engine has been mostly developed and after having started work on world 1-1 already.
